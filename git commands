Git Repository     
 - A folder where .git folder resides and this folder is under the version control.

GitHub Repository 
 - Online location where code and related files for a project are stored and 
   managed using Git version control.
 - platform for hosting Git repositories and provides additional features for collaboration,
   such as issue tracking, pull requests, project management, and more.

git remote add origin <repository_url>
 - command to add the URL of the GitHub repository as the remote origin
 
git remote remove <remote-name>           #default name is "origin"
 - Remove Existing Remote Configuration

git fetch origin
 -  to fetch branches from the new remote repository to update your
   local repository with its latest changes

git init
 - initializes an empty git repository
 - creates a hidden folder ".git" in the root of a git Repo.

git status
 - info about current state of the git repository.
 - commits made
 - tracked/untracked files

git checkout -b <branch_name>
 - creates and switch to a new branch

git checkout <branch_name>
 - switch to a new branch

git branch
 - gives info/list of all the branches in git

git add <file_name>
 - stages the file or changes made to a file you want to commit.
 - files are tracked at this stage

git restore --staged <file>
 - unstages changes for the specified file (<file>) that were 
   previously staged.

git rm --cached <file>
 - To remove a file from Git staging area without deleting it from 
   your local filesystem. 
git commit -m  <message>
 - commit changes with a specified commit message.

git restore <file_name>
- to restore the specified file to its state in the last commit. 

git diff
 - shows the changes that have been made to files in your working directory but 
   haven't been staged yet.

git diff --staged
 - changes that have been staged but haven't been committed yet.

git reset HEAD^
 - to undo the last commit.

         # HEAD is a reference that represents your current position in the Git repository.
         - it points to the latest commit on the currently active branch.

git diff branch1 branch2
 - difference between two branches

git fetch origin
git diff main origin/main
- fetches the latest changes from the remote Repo named "origin" and then compares the local "main" branch with
   the "main" branch on the remote repo.

git diff <local-branch> origin/<remote-branch>
- to see the changes without fetching the latest updates from the remote Repo.


git log
 - display the commit history in the repository.
 -  it shows a list of commits in reverse chronological order.
 -  shows commit hashes,author information, timestamps, and commit messages.
------------------------------------------------------------
Branches: for parallel development and experimentation without affecting the main codebase until
          changes are ready to be merged. 
 - Master or main: Primary branch of development in a project, such as
         main, master, or develop.
    - typically represents the most stable and latest version of the codebase.
    - must be kept up to date all the time.
 - Feature: used to develop new features or functionalities.
          - created off the main branch.
          - existing only until the feature is complete and ready to be
            merged back into the main branch.
 - Release branch: used to stabilize the codebase, fix bugs, and perform final testing before
                   deploying the release.
    - created from the main branch when preparing for a new release.
    - changes to this branch must be cascaded back to master branch.

 - Hotfix Branch: created to quickly address critical issues or bugs in the production code.
     - It is created from the main development branch.
     - changes must be merged back into both the main branch and any active release branches.
-------------------------------------------------

Commands:

git branch -d branch_name
 - delete the branch if its changes have been merged into the current
   branch.

git branch -D branch_name
 - force deletion
 - delete a branch regardless of whether its changes have been merged
   or not.

git clone <repo_path>
 - to clone the github repo into your local.

git remote -v
 - used to view the remote repositories associated with your local Git-Repo along with their URLs.

git push origin <branch_name>
git push <remote-name> <local-branch>:<remote-branch>       #<remote-name> is usually "origin" by default.
 - to push the changes from your local to your Github repo branch.


git pull origin <branch_name>
 - to pull the changes from your github/origin to your local-repo branch.

git remote add origin <remote_repository_url>       
 - to add a new remote repository to your local Git repository. 

git remote remove <remote-name>           #default name is "origin,"
 - To disconnect a remote GitHub repository from your local repository,

Interview questions:

What is the purpose of .git ignore files ?
 - contains unnecessary or sensitive files that Git should ignore.
 - excludes from being tracked by Git.
  

What is the staging/index area in git?
- middle ground between your working dir and the committed history.

what is difference between git pull and git fetch?
 - "git pull" is essentially a combination of "git fetch" followed
   by "git merge".
 - "git fetch" only downloads the changes from the remote repo to your
    local repo.
    Does not merge the changes into your current branch.

what is main branch?
 - in your loacl whenever you create a new git repo, by default branch
  is "main branch".

From which branch do you usually perform releases?
 - Release branch

what is the branch that is always up to date?
 - Main or Master

Difference between "git Merge" and "git Rebase" ?
 - Merge: integrates changes from source branch into target branch while preserving the
          commit history of both branches.
 - Rebase: rewrites the commit history by moving or re-applying the changes from source 
           branch onto target.
   maintains a linear history of commits.

Git clone and git fork?
 - clone is copy/downloading of existing remote repo onto the local machine.
 - fork is the copy of repo in user's GitHub account for collaboration and contribution purposes.
 
Purpose of  .git config?
- stores config setting for user git installation.

How do you remove a file from git without deleting it locally?
 - git rm --cached <file>

How do you resolve a conflict in a pull request?
 - fetch the changes locally 
 - create a new branch
 - resolve conflicts
 - commit changes
 - push the branch
 - update the pull request

 How do you revert a commit that has already been pushed to a remote repo?
  - git revert commit_hash

 How do you sign commits in git?
  - git commit -s -m <message>

 Git stash?
  - It's like a "clipboard" for your uncommitted changes.
  - Git takes all the changes in your working dir and stores them on a stack of stashes.
  - After stashing your changes, you can work on something else.
  - retrieve your stashed changes later by using "git stash apply" or
    "git stash pop".

 Git index?
  - it is a file that contains info about files to be included in the next commit.
  - bridge between working dir and Repo.

How do you handle versioning in git?
 - by using tags.
